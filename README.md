Svelte's Virtual List
=======================

A virtual list component for Svelte. It only renders the data that is visible on screen.

This is an improved version of https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list (@sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list). 

Here are the improvements:

1. Support variable height for each row.
2. Support sticky top rows and sticky left columns.
3. Support the detection of reaching the bottom. This is useful for supporting a load-more mechanism.
4. Support wider rows with the horizontal scrollbar.
5. Support saving the scroll positions on both axes.
6. Support row index.
